So I was in line WITH the cars as dictated by law since it is illegal to go on the sidewalk and I can maintain a speed equal to that of the cars until there is room for me to get over to the right again.  A woman in front of her house on the south side of Longden just before Rosemead began yelling at me that there was a car behind me (true) and that I didn\'t know how to ride a bike properly.  She was a complete distraction so that I did not see the light turn green right away and, thus, fell behind the cars in front me.  She actually worsened the situation rather than helped.  Clearly she does not have an accurate education regarding the rules of bikes on the road, and I didn\'t have time to (politely) help her understand without sacrificing my own safety or upsetting the people were actually driving.','license_plate'=>'','incident_date'=>'2009-11-25 11:00:00','incident_type'=>'Harassment','user_name'=>' ','user_email'=>'','user_phone'=>'','verified'=>'0'),

He passed with inches to spare between traffic, me, and a parked car with no warning. I yelled at him to get out of the bike lane and ride in traffic.  Eventually I passed him since his motor bike stalled at the red light.

He again passed me as I approached the red light at Glendon Ave and then stopped at the limit line at the far left in the bicycle lane.  I stayed back to avoid the motorized bike.  The light turned green and he started pedaling so slow I went to pass as I said "please, get out of the bike lane".  His Motorized Bicycle then stalled, began weaving, and then abruptly turned right in front of me to stop at the curb. I was accelerating and traveling at about 15 mph.  I turned and braked to avoid colliding with him and flew over my handlebars. He immediately said, "Its not my fault, its your fault I didn\'t do anything, you should hold your line."  I asked. "What?! You turned in front of me! You aren\'t allowed in the bike lane anyways."  He said, "It\'s a bicycle, I\'m going to work, you made me late to work, you caused me to stall by yelling at me."  He was using plenty of profanity and was slurring his words.  He then got his motor bike started and took off.  I couldn\'t chase him down since my chain derailed and my derailleur hanger was bent rendering my bike unusable for the moment.

The same motorist tends to pass us during morning commute honking, rolling down window, and screaming at us.  Frequently, while stopped at the light, she will call my fiancee a "stupid b*tch," yell at us to "get out of the road," and shout that she "recognizes" and is "watching" us.  

It started about 6 weeks ago when she nearly hit another nearby cyclist while honking and swerving around him.  The cyclists all glared at her when we were all waiting at the next light together, and she rolled down her window and started screaming about how bikes have to "get out of the road."  Since then, she honks and screams completely unprovoked whenever she sees us (almost weekly).  Her screams often mention how cyclists have to obey the law, but she doesn\'t say what supposed law we\'ve broken (we didn\'t break any--presumably she\'s referring to her imaginary law that cyclists are not allowed to ride in the street???), and she\'ll often pull up while we\'re waiting stationary at a stoplight and scream how we have to obey the law.

I\'ve contacted the police about it but have not yet filed a police report.  I\'m making a point of taking pictures and/or video of any future interactions.','license_plate'=>'','incident_date'=>'2010-08-23 10:33:00','incident_type'=>'Harassment','user_name'=>'Aaron Lawrence','user_email'=>'aaron.lawrence@gmail.com','user_phone'=>'608-345-3353','verified'=>'1'),

Last night I was riding my bike home with my fiance after having a nice birthday dinner. We are the safest bicyclists you\'ve ever met. Safe, safe, safe. Helmets, blinkers, following all traffic rules, respectful, super precautionary on the road and always moving out of the way for any and all cars. Well apparently that wasn\'t good enough for a jerk in a white/silver Volkeswagon. Initially, my fiance and I pulled out on to the road when the cars were gone and the road was totally clear. No car was visible going in our direction down 7th street. After getting on the road and after about 30-seconds later there was a sudden amount of major bright lights right up on/behind me. Even though they were behind me they were so close they were blinding. Feeling the stressful amount of light on my back I turned around to look and saw a white/silver Volkeswagon being driven by what appeared to be a Middle Eastern man. The man\'s vehicle was literally, and unnecessarily, half a foot away from my back tire. It all happened so fast I hadn\'t had much time to react other than being freaked out. The driver of the vehicle must\'ve been gunning for us and speeding down 7th (which the speed limit is 35 mph, if that even) because A. the road was 100% clear when we took to the street and B. he was at my back tire literally 30 seconds after getting on the street. He was so close I could feel the heat of his car on my back. Because it was such a threatening scenario I took out my cell camera and took a picture of his plate and car at an intersection. Then the driver began to follow me. At the next light the driver of the white/silver Volkeswagon rolls his window down and yells,

"YOU EXPECT ME TO SHARE THE ROAD WITH YOU?!?! YOU\'RE ON A BIKE GET A FUCKING CAR!!!"

The light turned green and the driver proceeded to follow me honking like a nut job for 2 more blocks. He even drove up and passed me and then got in front of me and slammed on his breaks. He slammed on his breaks to make me hit the back of his car like the SUV driver did in Mandeville Canyon two years ago. I was lucky and avoided the collision. He continued to yell, curse at, and follow me till I told him I am filming his stupidity. After that, he went on his merry way.','license_plate'=>'','incident_date'=>'2011-03-12 02:11:00','incident_type'=>'Harassment','user_name'=>'Tamara ','user_email'=>'june4th@gmail.com','user_phone'=>NULL,'verified'=>'1'),

One had a photo of her plate.
Gray BMW.
The police found her, but she still is still driving.','license_plate'=>'','incident_date'=>'2011-05-18 09:38:00','incident_type'=>'Hit & Run with minor or no injuries','user_name'=>'Dana Johnson','user_email'=>'googleacticgal@aol.com','user_phone'=>'','verified'=>'0'),

I was legally within the right lane where there is no shoulder. I was the only person/vehicle on the road in my direction and there was another lane to my left that allowed for cars to pass my safely. I was nearly hit by a green Subaru wagon that was exceeding the speed limit and made a dangerous maneuver of changing to the left lane very close behind me and back to the right lane very close in front of me. It was obviously a posturing action that was meant to threaten me and let me know they didn\'t think i should be riding in the road.

I caught up to the car where it was stopped at the intersection of Colorado and Figueroa, facing west. I pulled-up to the driver\'s window and calmly (yes, actually calmly and politely) let the driver (A white male with shaggy brown hair and a beard, who looked to be late 30s-early 40s) know that what he did was VERY close and VERY dangerous. to which he said i shouldn\'t have been riding in the middle of the lane. My response of letting him know I was where I was legally allowed to be and supposed to be angered him. He replied by saying "You have to admit it\'s pretty douchey for you to be riding in the road." My response was "It\'s nowhere near as bad as almost killing me." To which he yelled "Well, next time I will kill you!" He then preceded to speed-off as the light had changed to green during this exchange.

I quickly made a note of the license plate number, pulled onto the sidewalk on the northwest corner of the intersection and called the Rampart Community Police Station of the LAPD. The officer was very helpful and patient with my call and informed me that due to the circumstantial nature of the driver\'s threat, there was no action I could take. He then offered to go check with his supervisor and put me on hold. While I was on hold, I saw the same car and driver heading the other direction (east) on Colorado, leaning out his window hollering at me as he drove by. When the officer returned to the call, he apologized and informed me that there really wasn\'t anything I could do at this point.

The vehicle was a green Subaru wagon that I believe was a late 90s to early 00s Subaru Outback, with a California license plate that read: 3WDB940','license_plate'=>'','incident_date'=>'2011-05-12 07:07:00','incident_type'=>'Harassment','user_name'=>' ','user_email'=>'alexbeerlist@gmail.com','user_phone'=>NULL,'verified'=>'1'),

The handlebar pads were very sticky. Also the wheels didn\'t have the air-stoppers and the gears were messed up. It had a few bumper stickers including one for a solar panel company.

My friend gave me the broken bike (the gears were messed up but it was still kind of ride-able) just a couple days ago. Since I didn\'t think anybody could ride very far on it, let alone want it enough to steal, I left it unlocked in the back of my apartment building.

I pulled out of the bike lane to avoid construction in the bike lane.   Shortly afterwards, I hear honking.  I look behind me, and a red minivan is laying on the horn, behind a biker behind me who also had to pull in to the lane.

By the time the minivan has caught up to me, I had to pull out of the bike lane again to avoid a parked car.  He lays on the horn, again.  I flip him the finger.  When I pull back in to the bike lane, he moves ahead of me, and then pulls in to the bike lane.  He slows down, forcing me to put on the brakes and pull off to the side of the lane.  After 30 seconds of this,  he drove away.

Witnesses gave me the driver\'s license plate.

The car was a red minivan, with a handicap plaque hanging in the window.  Driver was male, with a white beard.  Looked maybe in his 50’s.  License plate 4CYM305.','license_plate'=>'','incident_date'=>'2011-08-16 06:16:00','incident_type'=>'Harassment','user_name'=>'Mike Stein','user_email'=>'mike.j.stein@gmail.com','user_phone'=>NULL,'verified'=>'1')
